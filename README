NAME
	ZFOR - Z Fail-Over Resolver

DESCRIPTION
	ZFOR is a virtual hostname resolver that supports health checking and
	load-balancing. It could be used to take over some VIP works.

COMPILE ZFOR

* Prerequsite: erlang(>=R11B), gcc(>=3.4), (optional) php(>=5.2), alien
* Steps:
	0. MAKE SURE TO change the content of cfg/erlang.cookie
	1. make PREFIX=/usr/local (Compiling zfor server and client library)
	2. (optional) make PREFIX=/usr/local ext (Compiling PHP extension)
	3. make PREFIX=/usr/local pkg (Make zfor server package)
	4. (optional) make PREFIX=/usr/local ext-pkg (Make zfor PHP package)


INSTALL ZFOR

* For .tgz package:
	1. sudo tar -xzpPf zfor*.tgz
	2. (optional) sudo tar -xzpPf php-zfor*.tgz

* For .deb package:
	1. sudo dpkg -i zfor*.deb
	2. (optional) sudo dpkg -i php-zfor*.deb

* For .rpm package:
	1. sudo rpm -Uvh zfor*.rpm
	2. (optional) sudo rpm -Uvh php-zfor*.rpm


ZFOR ADMIN

* sudo -u nobody zfor-start (Start zfor server)
* sudo -u nobody zfor-stop (Stop zfor server)
* zfor-conf (Dump current config files read by zfor server)
* zfor-stat (Dump current host status stored in zfor server)
* zfor-host <hostname> (Resolve given hostname through zfor service)
* zfor-shell (Connect to zfor server shell, press ^Gq to quit. Use with care!)

NOTES

* In the latest libzfor.so, getaddrinfo() is intercepted and most program using this function should be able to working along with ZFOR by simply preloading libzfor.so. No more need to modifying code to resolve hostnames using zfor_gethostbyname() explicitly. For example:

	$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libzfor.so curl "http://a.zfor"

But the CURL function in PHP with Suhosin security patch (like the one comes within Ubuntu-release) is an exception. The alternative way to make it working is preloading both libzfor.so and libcurl.so, as the following shows:

	$ LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libcurl.so /usr/local/lib/libzfor.so" php -r '$ch=curl_init("http://xx.zfor");curl_exec($ch);'

* zfor_gethostbyname() / zfor_getaddrinfo() defaults to fail-back mode: when resolving failed through zfor service, turn to use system-wide DNS resolving APIs to do the job. You can use zfor_gethostbyname2() / zfor_getaddrinfo2() to control the fail-back behavior. When using preloading way, the fail-back mode can be controlled through environment variable ZFOR_HOOK_CTL, set it to "nfb" to use non-failback mode, and "fb" (which is default) to use failback mode, for example:

	$ ZFOR_HOOK_CTL=nfb LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libzfor.so curl "http://a.zfor"
